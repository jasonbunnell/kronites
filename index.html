                            My uncle, Kip Slawter, was in an accident that left him a quadriplegic.  He is a pastor, but the accident made preaching impossible.  He wanted to continue spreading the gospel and share his story as a quadripelegic, so I have helped him with his site.  The site is a WordPress site that is now hosted on HostGator.  I provide quarterly analytics on traffic sources and his most popular posts.  I also implemented social sharing, a custom theme, and optimized the site for search engines.
